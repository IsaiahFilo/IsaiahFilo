Hi I'm Isaiah,
I am a new coder, I have been learning for around a month. I have learnt the basics in C#, HTML5 and CSS. I am currently studying to become a front-end developer,
eventually progressing towards full stack.
I will be updating my GitHub with all my projects so feel free to leave any feedback or criticism.
